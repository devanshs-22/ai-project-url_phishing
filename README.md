So, some infromation about how we are now handling the features and extracting them
like now ,
i am picking 5000 random legit websites and 5000 phishing webistes and extracting 16 featrues for each of them, then contacting them
10,000 websites and shuffeling them into dataset named final.csv




Latest Update on the dataset 
We have decided to change the older dataset and reduce the unnecesary features from the dataset 
now our dataset contains features based on basically three things 
1. Address Type
2. Domain Based
3. Html and java script based

So, like for Address based features we have 9 sub features -
1.Domain of Url
2.IP Address
3.@ symbol
4.Length of Url
5.Depth of url
6.Redirection '//'
7.'http/https' present
8.Url shortening service
9.prefix - suffix used 


Now for the Domain based features
1.DNS record
2.Age of Domain
4.End period of Domain

HTML based features

1.Iframe Redirection
2.Disabling Right click
3.Website Fordwarding
